    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A mathematical detour\n",
    "\n",
    "According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence, \n",
    "\n",
    "> a (mathematical) **sequence** is an ordered collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put in other terms, this is an ordered way to encode a *multiset*, and the simplest encoding is to associate\n",
    " to each element of the multiset a natural number giving its \"position\" in the ordering relation. The first element is at position 0, the second at position 1, etc. This gives a functional interpretation of a sequence. In this interpretation a sequence can have a *finite* or *infinite* domain, in which case we say that the sequence is finite or infinite.\n",
    " \n",
    "There is also an inductive definition of a finite sequence, being the *smallest* set composed of either :\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the empty sequence `nil`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - or a non-empty sequence, `cons`tructed from a `first` element and the `rest` of the sequence.\n",
    "  \n",
    "You then obtained the definition of a `list`, our ubiquitous data structure  (well, its proper, immutable variant) ! The guarantee that the sequence is finite here is that we take the *smallest* set satisfying the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about *infinite* sequences ?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is indeed a related mathematical definition of an infinite sequence, being the *largest* set composed of\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a `head` elements followed by an infinite `tail` sequence\n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that there is no base case and moreover we consider this time the *largest* set satisfying the unique rule. Such definition is said *coinductive* and though it is a very interesting theory, a very concrete take on *infinity*, we have everything we need to go back to the practical side of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the inductive and coinductive definitions are compatible, identifying `first` with `head`, and `rest` with `tail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our short mathematical *detour* leads to the following, conceptually important but somewhat bare Lisp code :"

If there are interesting books about Clojure (well, *not* all of them), they are in general rather short on the technical details concering some aspects of the implementation, especially lazy sequences. This is probably related to the fact that most of these technical details are on the Java side of things... Of course, Haskell is an excellent example, in that lazy sequences are simply ... lists since (almost) everything is lazy there. There are related concepts in many languages, e.g. Python generators, Ruby blocks, Java streams, etc.\n",
